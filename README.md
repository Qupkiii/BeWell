# BeWell
Android app to be a co-pilot for psychaitrists to extend their attention and for GPs to recognize the potentional symptoms of depression.

## Use cases
- chat bot checks on patient: medicine intake, thoughts. Check intervals are adjusted based on response, state of therapy.
- sends notification to psychaitrist and optional if patient health is declining(based on responses)
- helps the GPs to redirect potentionally depressive patients to the psychiatrist

## Ideas
- interactive map for locally available resoruces (e.g. psychaitrists(booking as well?), suicide centers, nearby activites)
- gp and psychaitrist interaction through app
- the app can recognize the need for psy. visit
- booking as well, or integrating a booking app
- supports the clinician to diagnose of depression (more data of the patient is avaiable on day to day basis, also use of scietificly proven questionares)
- involves the relatives/friends/family in the treatment
- gives tips/educational material both to the patient and to the supporting relatives (text, audio, video forms)
- avaiable literature in local language
- use of mood charts so that both the patient and the clinician can follow the current satutus (daily/weekly/monthly) of the patient
- use of ingaging activities (preferably locally avaiable options) eg. breathing technics/ walk in the nearest park/ explore your neighbourhood
- the app can look for correlations between specific actvities and the retrospective values of the mood chart and suggest activity to the patient
- daily diary function (also could be evaluated by looking for specific words and connecitons)
- local problems/contexts/situations e.g. specificly applyable for Hungarians
- stories/cases of similar patients with similar problems from the same country
- sleep and step monitoring (smart-watches)
- appoinment and phonebook (GP, helpline, psychiatrist) chat with GP/clinician?
- link to local mental helath forums
