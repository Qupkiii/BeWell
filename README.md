# BeWell
Android app to be a co-pilot for psychaitrists to extend their attention and for GPs to recognize the potentional symptoms of depression.

## Use cases
- chat bot checks on patient: medicine intake, thoughts. Check intervals are adjusted based on response, state of therapy.
- sends notification to psychaitrist and optional if patient health is declining(based on responses)
- helps the GPs to redirect potentionally depressive patients to the psychiatrist

## Ideas
- interactive map for locally available resoruces (e.g. psychaitrists(booking as well?), suicide centers, nearby activites)
- gp and psychaitrist interaction through app
- the app can recognize the need for psy. visit
- booking as well, or integrating a booking app
- supports the clinician to diagnose of depression (more data of the patient is avaiable on day to day basis, also use of scietificly proven questionares)
- involves the relatives/friends/family in the treatment
- gives tips/educational material both to the patient and to the supporting relatives (text, audio, video forms)
- avaiable literature in local language
- use of mood charts so that both the patient and the clinician can follow the current satutus (daily/weekly/monthly) of the patient
- use of ingaging activities (preferably locally avaiable options) eg. breathing technics/ walk in the nearest park/ explore your neighbourhood
- the app can look for correlations between specific actvities and the retrospective values of the mood chart and suggest activity to the patient
- daily diary function (also could be evaluated by looking for specific words and connecitons)
- local problems/contexts/situations e.g. specificly applyable for Hungarians
- stories/cases of similar patients with similar problems from the same country
- sleep and step monitoring (smart-watches)
- appoinment and phonebook (GP, helpline, psychiatrist) chat with GP/clinician?
- link to local mental health forums

## Our application
Depression is one of the most common psychiatric problem both in the developed and in the developing countries. Despite the increasing number of cases many of the patients does not get the appropriate treatment and relapse many times. The reason for that among others are the social stigmatisation, lack of psychiatric staff, overflow of healthcare systems and lack of fast and sustainable diagnosing and monitoring tools.

 Our app aims to be help for the GPs to recognise the potentially depressive patients with the help of acknowledged questionnaires, keep them monitored and act as the starting point in the diagnostic algorithm. In addition to that also the patients and their family can be more involved in their treatment, monitor their current status, write down their day to day experience in our diary function, get to know more about this disease through similar cases and stories of patients and with the use of high quality education materials in the form of text, audio and video.
 BeWell could take some of the burden off of the GPs and clinicians without the loss of information about the patient. The patients could make the first steps to understand their situation, get educated, provide more up to date information to the healthcare professionals and monitor their status. 

Among the future plans we aim to help the patient to stay organised both in their everyday life and in their treatment, future plans are to create a reminder feature, which can remind the user to take their medicine, offer activities to the patient using the geolocation and recommend activities to the user e.g. walk in the park if its nearby or list the available professionals/ suicide centers. We also want to include gamification features to get more engaged, fill out the Beck's Depression Inventory every month, measure passive data (steps made, quality of sleep) to provide more accurate information to the clinician, provide visual data like mood charts and analysis of the gathered data and provided educational material available in local language and local sources. 

During the hackathon we made the following progress. We started the development of an android application with Android Studio. The authentication and data storage is done by Firebase. The user can fill out a Beck's Depression Inventory. The software was made for Android 5.0 OP system so that 98% of the current Android running devices can use BeWell.
