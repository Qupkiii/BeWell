# BeWell
Android app to be a co-pilot for psychaitrists to extend their attention and for GPs to recognize the potentional symptoms of depression.

## Use cases
- chat bot checks on patient: medicine intake, thoughts. Check intervals are adjusted based on response, state of therapy.
- sends notification to psychaitrist and optional if patient health is declining(based on responses)
- helps the GPs to redirect potentionally depressive patients to the psychiatrist

## Ideas
- interactive map for available psychaitrists(booking as well?), suicide centers
- gp and psychaitrist interaction through app
- the app can recognize the need for psy. visit
- booking as well, or integrating a booking app
- supports the clinician to diagnose of depression (more data of the patient is avaiable on day to day basis)
- involves the relatives/friends/family in the treatment
- gives tips/educational material both to the patient and to the supporting relatives
